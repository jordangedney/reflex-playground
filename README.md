Reflex Demo Game
================

Not so much of a "game" as yet, given there are no goals or victory conditions,
but it does a sweet as ray-caster.

You can look around and that seems to work, but moving is a bit wonky. Use the
arrow keys to move/look around. You have to click the top canvas before the keys
will register. Because I didn't do a global bind on the key events, only key
events that are triggered from the canvas.
